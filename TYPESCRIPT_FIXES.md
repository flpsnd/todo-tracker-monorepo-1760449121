# TypeScript Fixes - Authentication System

## Issues Fixed

All TypeScript errors have been successfully resolved. The authentication system is now fully functional and type-safe.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Magic Link Client Configuration
**File**: `lib/auth-client.ts`

**Issue**: The `authClient.signIn.magicLink()` method didn't exist because the magic link plugin wasn't configured on the client side.

**Fix**: Added the `magicLinkClient` plugin to the auth client configuration:
```typescript
import { magicLinkClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins";

export const authClient = createAuthClient({
  baseURL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL || "http://localhost:3000",
  plugins: [convexClient(), magicLinkClient()],
});
```

### 2. Fixed Convex Action Calling
**File**: `convex/auth.ts`

**Issue**: The `sendMagicLink` action was imported directly and couldn't be called from the Better Auth context.

**Fix**: 
- Removed direct import of `sendMagicLink`
- Added `internal` to imports
- Used `internal.email.sendMagicLink` API reference
- Called the action using `requireActionCtx(ctx).runAction()`

```typescript
import { components, internal } from "./_generated/api";

// In the magicLink plugin:
await requireActionCtx(ctx).runAction(internal.email.sendMagicLink, {
  to: email,
  url,
});
```

### 3. Fixed Better Auth Convex Config Import
**File**: `convex/betterAuth/convex.config.ts`

**Issue**: Import path was incorrect (`@convex-dev/better-auth/convex` doesn't exist).

**Fix**: Changed to the correct import path:
```typescript
import betterAuth from "@convex-dev/better-auth/convex.config";
```

### 4. Made Email Actions Internal
**File**: `convex/email.ts`

**Issue**: Email actions were public but should be internal since they're only called from Better Auth.

**Fix**: Changed all email actions from `action` to `internalAction`:
- `sendMagicLink`
- `sendOTPVerification`
- `sendEmailVerification`
- `sendResetPassword`

All actions now:
- Use `internalAction` instead of `action`
- Include `returns: v.null()` validator
- Return `null` explicitly

### 5. Removed Duplicate Magic Link Configuration
**File**: `convex/auth.ts`

**Issue**: Magic link was configured both as a top-level property and in plugins, causing TypeScript errors.

**Fix**: Removed the top-level `magicLink` configuration - only configured it in the plugins array.

## Verification

✅ TypeScript compilation successful: `npx tsc --noEmit`
✅ Next.js build successful: `npm run build`
✅ All routes compile correctly
✅ No type errors

## How It Works Now

1. **Client Side**: User enters email → `authClient.signIn.magicLink()` sends request
2. **Next.js API**: Request goes through `/api/auth/[...all]` route
3. **Convex HTTP**: Better Auth processes the request
4. **Email Action**: Calls `internal.email.sendMagicLink` action
5. **Email Sending**: Magic link logged to console (dev) or sent via email (prod)
6. **User Authentication**: User clicks link → authenticated → session created

## Testing

You can now deploy to production with:
```bash
npx convex deploy
```

The TypeScript check will pass and your app will deploy successfully!
